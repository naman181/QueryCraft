option a: PDA acceptance using final state and empty stack are different.
option b: PDA acceptance using final state and empty stack are equivalent.
option c: PDA acceptance using both final state and empty stack are different.
option d: All PDA acceptance mechanisms are equivalent.
correct Answer: option b: PDA acceptance using final state and empty stack are equivalent.
Explanation: In PDA, the acceptance mechanism is the way in which a string is accepted by the machine. There are three types of PDA acceptance mechanisms: PDA acceptance using final state, PDA acceptance using empty stack, and PDA acceptance using both final state and empty stack. These mechanisms are equivalent, meaning that they can recognize the same set of strings. Therefore, option b is the correct answer.


Question 2: What is the difference between DPDA and PDA?

Option a: DPDA has more than one final state.
Option b: DPDA has only one final state.
Option c: DPDA can accept both final and non-final strings.
Option d: DPDA cannot accept non-final strings.
Correct answer: Option b: DPDA has only one final state.

Explanation: A DPDA (Deterministic Pushdown Automaton) is a type of automaton that can recognize deterministic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic context-istic
